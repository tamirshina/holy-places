    openingParagraph: `
      Between 1850 and 1917, the Russian Empire and the Russian Church erected dozens of buildings throughout the Middle East and Palestine in particular. During these years, the industrial revolution and the progress that swept the Western world tends to reach our regions.
      The Russian people during these years felt a deep connection with the Land of Israel and the holy sites of Christianity.
       Many funds and resources were invested in Palestine by the Russian government and people, construction of churches and monasteries, infrastructure and a growing pilgrimage of Russian trainers who make pilgrimages to Jerusalem every year.
      All of these contributed greatly to the development of the Land of Israel. The impact of this activity is still evident today, as beautiful churches adorn the landscape of the country and the big cities.`

      <b>חיפה - כנסיית אליהו הנביא </b>
      אט אט עם גבור זרם הצליינים לארץ ישראל ולקראת שיאו ב-1913 התחילו צליינים להגיע גם לנמל חיפה. בעקבות כך נרכשה חלקת אדמה ב- 1908 ע"י הארכימנדריט ליאוניד סצנוב, בתחילה השלטונות התורכים סירבו לתת למקום אישור. בסופו של דבר התרצו השלטונות התורכים וביום הציון 300 שנה לשושלת רומנוב נפתחה הכנסייה ובית מחסה לצליינים.  
      לאליהו הנביא מקום של כבוד בנצרות גם משום שמקורות מסויימים מציינים שיוחנן המטביל ואליהו הנביא הם אותה הדמות וגם בשל מלחמתו של אליהו הנביא בעבודת האלילים.

      <b>טבריה ע"ש מריה מגדלן</b>
      על שפת הכנרת בנוף הגליל, קמה כנסייה ע"ש מריה מגדלן. ב1908 רכש הארכימנדריט לאוניד את השטח עליו הוקמה שנים מאוחר יותר הכנסייה. הארכימנדריט ליאוניד תיאר את המקום כך "המקום הוא אואזיס נפלא לצידו של האגם" 
      כאן ע"פ המסורת הנוצרית ריפא ישו את מרים המגדלית, הלא היא מריה מגדלן. 
      "וְנָשִׁים אֲשֶׁר נִרְפְּאוּ מֵרוּחוֹת רָעוֹת וּמֵחֳלָיִים מִרְיָם הַנִּקְרָאָה מַגְדָּלִית אֲשֶׁר גֹּרְשׁוּ מִמֶּנָּה שִׁבְעָה שֵׁדִים׃." הבשורה ע"פ לוקאס.
      נזירות רוסיות מטפלות במקום היפיפיה במורדות הגליל.

      68 acres of land near the Jaffa Gate, which are now part of central Jerusalem, but in the years when Russian interest in Jerusalem was renewed, it was a tract of land surrounding agricultural land outside the Old City walls.
