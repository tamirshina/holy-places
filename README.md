Holy places is one of seven media centers located in Sergi- courtyard  hotel in Jerusalem. 

Each media center aims to deliver information about the Russian presents in the holy land from the 19th century till the first world war.  

It is written in React- js Hooks. 

All media centers run on Windows Chrome without any need for internet connection. 

It is maintained by me :)
